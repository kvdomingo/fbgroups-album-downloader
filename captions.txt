23: Paulo Fabregas  “Dream With Me”       One time, I came across Petra Collins while surfing the web - I fell in love with her photography at first sight. Her works have been described as hyper-feminine and dream-like. She has been one of my great inspirations ever since.        With this study, I wanted to evoke a vision akin to her dream-like photography. Blinding yellow light, reflection from a hand-held mirror, an apparent soft mist are elements of an imaginary world. Altogether they ask the question - will you dream with me?
